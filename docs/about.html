            project. There are many database models. Students will get experience with multiple database models, as

                allows):

            <li>Relational: MySQL.</li>

    <h2>Course Overview</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Each section of W4111 is slightly different based on student's interest and professor's focus.
        There is a common, core syllabus. Professors cover topics in different orders and grouping based
        on teaching style.
    <p>This section of W4111  has four modules:
    <ul>
            <li><b>Foundational concepts (50% of semester):</b> This module covers concepts like data models,
            relational model, relational databases and applications,
            schema, normalization, … The module focuses on the relational model and relational databases.
            The concepts are critical and foundational for all types of databases and data centric applications.</li>
        <li><b>Database management system architecture and implementation (10%):</b> This module covers the software
            architecture, algorithms and implementation techniques that allow
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database#Database_management_system">
            databases management systems</a>  to
            deliver functions. Topics include memory hierarchy, storage systems, caching/buffer pools, indexes,
            query processing, query optimization, transaction processing, isolation and concurrency control.</li>
            <li><b>NoSQL – “Not Only SQL” databases (20%):</b> This module provides motivation for
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">“NoSQL”</a> data models and
            databases, and covers examples and use cases. The module also includes cloud databases and
            databases-as-a-service. </li>
            <li><b>Data Enabled Decision Support (20%):</b> This module covers data warehouses, data import and cleanse,
            OLAP, Pivot Tables, Star Schema, reporting and visualization, and provides and overview of analysis
            techniques, e.g. clustering, classification, analysis, mining.</li>

            <h2>Programming versus Non-Programming Tracks</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Students taking the class have vastly different programming experience and interest in programming.
                To accomodate the diverse experience and interests, all sections of W4111 offer a programming track
                and a non-programming track.
            </p>
            <p>
                The department's description of the programming/non-programming is:
            </p>
            <p>
            "To accommodate the diverse backgrounds of the students who take this class, all sections of
                the class should include a non-programming option for projects and assignments.
                We have successfully offered such an option in some sections of the class for many years:
                students can either program a web application to interface with a DB of their own design,
                or alternatively follow the non-programming option and come up with a
                quantifiably more detailed DB design/data."
            </p>
            <p>
            What does not constitute programming?
            <ul>
           <li>Writing queries for a relational, graph, document, or other data management system does not constitute
               programming and can be expected of all students.
           </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            What constitutes programming?
                <ul>
            <li>
            Writing more than a handful (1-5) lines of code, that is not directly required to write a query."
            </li>
        </ul>
            <p>
                The difference will become clear when we provide the details on HW 1, and we will also explain the
                differences in the first lecture.
            </p>
            <p>
                All students will learn a common core material, and all HW assignments will cover the core in addition to
                track specific concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Exams are the same for both tracks. Exams test the common core.</b>
            </p>
