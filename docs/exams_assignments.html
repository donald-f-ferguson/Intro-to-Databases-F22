            We grade the class on a point system. Exams and homework assignments are worth various points. The points
            for the individual homework assignments are below. The midterm exam is work 20 points and the final
            exam is work 30 points.
        </p>

            There will be 5 homework assignments, and a HW 0 that you complete to set up your environment. You will
            find information on HW 0 on CourseWorks and below when we publish.

            Homework assignments are a combination of written questions reinforcing
            critical concepts and practical exercises. The practical exercises requires using databases,
            e.g. database queries, designing schema, etc.

                <li>One minute past the deadline counts as a full late date. You accrue one additional day for
                every 24 hours.</li>
                <li>You can apply as many remaining late days that you have to any homework assignment.</li>
                <li>Once you have used all late days, a late assignment gets a 0.</li>

                <p>Programming Description:</p>

                <p> The first part of this homework will be more theoretical and will focus on different aspects of relational database systems.
                    It was designed for students to better understand building blocks, namely different types of keys, relationships, and definitions.
                    This section will also ask you to model a database using <a href="https://Lucidchart.com">Lucid Chart </a>. You will also become
                    familiar with relational algebra, which is a theoretical declarative query language. These concepts are integral and important to
                    understand before diving into the code and applications.

                </p>
                <p> The next section of the homework is an application based where you will first "clean up" the lahman2019 database that you loaded in HW0.
                Data cleaning is an integral part of DBMS and is something that you will need to know for industry. In the homework we ask you to add primary
                 and foreign keys, change column types, take care of null fields and add appropriate columns. You will need
                to do this for both the People and Batting Tables. All of this can be done within the DataGrips editor, where you can copy and paste the SQL Script
                generated from the Modify Table pop-up. For each change you make to the tables, we want to you explain <i> why </i> you are making the change and why it is important.
                Being a good data engineer does not just consist of knowing SQL and being able to work with different applications, but higher thinking and being able to explain
                every design choice you made. We then ask you some SQL queries, which should be fairly simplistic. You might want to check out documentation on
                    <a href="https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-aggregate-functions/">aggregate functions.> </a> </p>

                <p> The final section of this homework is asking for you to implement basic query functions to manipulate CSV files. You will build on this code later in the semester,
                but for now it is important that not only does each function perform according to its definition but that you add integrity constraints. Try manipulating tables in SQL
                with primary keys, and figure out what you are allowed to do and what throws errors - your methods are simpler but should perform in the same manner. </p>

                <p> When completed, please PDF your .ipnyb and upload it to GradeScope, then upload your .zip file containing your code, and all other items in the subsequent
                    assignment section. </p>

                    namely different types of keys, relationships, and definitions. This section will also ask you to model a database using
                    <a href="https://Lucidchart.com">Lucid Chart </a>. You will also become familiar with relational algebra,
                    which is a theoretical declarative query language. These concepts are integral and important to understand before diving into the applications.

                The next section of the homework is application based. You will first load CSV files into a pandas DataFrame.
                <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html">Here is the documentation. </a>. Then you will upload this DataFrame to SQL.
                All of the code, save 2 lines and your log-in info, is written for you. Be sure to understand what each line is achieving.

                Then you will "clean up" the lahman2019 database that you loaded in HW0.
                Data cleaning is an integral part of DBMS and is something that you will need to know for industry. In the homework we ask you to add primary
                 and foreign keys, change column types, take care of null fields and add appropriate columns. Some of these tasks are better to be accomplished in SQL,
                like adding keys and changing column types. All of this can be done within the DataGrips editor, where you can copy and paste the SQL Script
                generated from the Modify Table pop-up. However, using pandas is an effective way to manipulate strings or add columns to dataframes, which is why
                we ask you to also manipulate the dataframe and then upload those changes to SQL.
                For each change we ask you to make, it should specify whether we want you to use SQL or Python. You will need
                to do this for the People, Batting and Teams Tables.  For each change you make to the tables, we want to you explain <i> why </i> you are making the change and why it is important.
                Being a good data engineer does not just consist of knowing SQL and being able to work with different applications, but higher thinking and being able to explain
                every design choice you made. We then ask you some SQL queries, which increase in difficulty. You might want to check out documentation on

                <p> When completed, please PDF your .ipnyb and upload it to GradeScope, then upload your .zip file containing your code, and all other items in the subsequent
                    assignment section. </p>
