                    Who Code Summer Immersion Program. In her free time, Amelia loves to read, cook, and try
                    new restaurants. This course was one of her favorites thus far at Columbia, and she is so
                    excited to work with you all this semester!

                    Siqi is a grad student in SEAS majoring in Computer Science with a Machine Learning track.
                    She took this course with Professor Ferguson in Spring 2022. This course was extremely
                    helpful and informative. Especially, when she interned as a software engineer at Google last
                    summer, she used a lot of DB knowledge she picked up in this course. This is her first time
                    TAing for this course and she is looking forward to meeting and working with you all
                    this semester!
